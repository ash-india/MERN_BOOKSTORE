npm init -y

package.json
type : module  in package.json allows the eccmascript modules like import and exports

npm i express nodemon

in scripts 
    start:node index.js
    dev:nodemon index.js


A file config.js for the port

app.get('/') for the response

mongodb account created
database created, and connection string is copied and put in config.js
password is replaced by user password and also coolection is added like books-collection

npm i mongoose - to manage mongodb (mongoose is a library)

connect mongoose with mongoDB with url

put app.isten isnside try of mongoose, the express server will run only when database is connected successfully

Now the database model is put in models folder and bookModel.js


{
  'title':'hey',
  'author':'harry',
  'publishYear':2019
}

first we implemented the app.post("/books") which on taking the details of books will create a new book

on sending this text in json format, it produces 500 internal server error as described in index.js in catch block in app.post("/books);

so for these we have to use a middleware express.json(),
this will parse the incoming json requests into javascript objects

now, app.get("/books") is implemented

app.post helps in creating a new record
while app.get is getting all the books

app.get('/books/:id') helps to get one book where id of book is id. in url id is the parameters for request

update a record
we will use put method which is used to update the record found by id

delete is used to delete a record

all the middleware or http routes were moved to new folder routes 

Now
app.use("/books",bookRoutes) This will allso to use all the http methods with url starting with /books
Now since /books is already defined we will remove /books from all the http methods in routes/booksRoute.js



CORS policy

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is a security feature implemented by web browsers that restricts web pages
from making requests to a different domain or origin than the one that served the web page.
The server checks whether the request is permitted or not. It checks the origin methods header and then allows or deny the request to the server

npm i cors 

cors is installed and imported
app.use(cors) to allow cors

npm create vite@latest   to install vite
project name frontend

tailwind for vite

npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p     with this command both postcss.config.js and tailwind.config.js is created

content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
this in tailwind.config.js

in src there is input.css remove all and add 
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

In app.jsx,
create a new rafce, 

Now for SPA- Single Page Application

npm i react-router-dom

index.html in frontend is using main.jsx in script

in main import {BrowserRouter} from 'react-router-dom'
and put BrowserRouter in place of React.StrictMode

in app.jsx import route and routes from react-router-dom

Five components are created create show edit delete home

and all are impoted in app.jsx

Route is to specify how a particular route should be rendered
and Routes is used to group a number of Route
with the help of react-router-dom frontend ables to listen the route(url)

npm i axios react-icons

Axios is a popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests in both web browsers and Node.js. It provides a 
simple and consistent API for performing asynchronous operations with HTTP, such as sending GET, POST, PUT, 
DELETE, and other types of HTTP requests.

Pages are different pages which is for different operations

Link is similar to <a> tag in html used in react

Spinner is when loading of data is going on, and this is the buffering icon

Components like Spinner, BackButton will be used in almost every page

useParams is used for parameters passed with url

Every page is created (create, show, delete, edit, upadate) i.e. crud operations done.

Now to have ifferent UI, we can display data in home paga in tabular format 
i.e. tables or with the help of cards

For this two more components are created BooksTable and BooksCard

The contents of table tag are put in BooksTable with parameter passed the data of book, 
which has been generated in home page using axios and this is passed to BooksTable

Fist BookCard is created and with the help of map() (same in BookTable) all the sets of data has been used

Now BooCard use BookSingleCard component, here all the mapping part is put, and in BookCard in map 
each object is passed to BookSingleCard and also a key is passed which is necessary. as react ask for keys

BookModal another component used to give a summary of each book by a popping tab

onClose -> this leads to closing of the tab which is opened

event.stopPropagation() stops any event on the window i.e. clicking on that will not close the window
(parent div has property onclick = {onClose} so to prevent this on the child div stopPrapagation(0 is used))

Now this BookModal is imported in BookSingleCard 


npm i notistack in frontend for better UI notifications or alert messages
Here we have imported the SnackbarProvider and used it and also keep the <App> tag inside it.
So we have to access to it in all our projects
